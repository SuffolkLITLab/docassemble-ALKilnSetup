question: |
  Mix of code and proxy var
subquestion: |
  The name fields variables will be using `users[0]` while the last field
  will be using `users[i]`. The sought variable will be using
  `users[0]`. The testing framework needs to be able to handle that.
fields:
  - code: |
      users[i].name_fields()
  - A proxy var: users[i].proxy_var
