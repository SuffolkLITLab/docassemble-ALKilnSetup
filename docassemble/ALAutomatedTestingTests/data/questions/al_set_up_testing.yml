  Document Assembly Line automated integrated testing
subquestion: |
  This tool helps developers or organizations set up automated integrated testing for docassemble packages that have a GitHub repository.
  
  :clock: This task can take up to 30 minutes.
  
  What you can set up depends on your situation and what kind of GitHub permissions you have.
fields:
  - Are you the admin of the {GitHub organization}?: is_org_admin
    datatype: yesnoradio
terms:
  - GitHub organization: If you don't know what a GitHub organization is, then you are not an admin of a GitHub organization.

question: |
  What do you need to do?
subquestion: |
  % if is_org_admin:
  You said you are the admin of an organization.
  
  Using this form you can {set up GitHub secrets}, or set up the testing package files in a repository, or both. If you set up secrets, you can choose to create secrets for your organization or for a specific repository.
  % else:
  From your answer, it sounds like you are a developer on the repository and can change files in the repository.
  
  Using this form you can set up GitHub secrets for the repository, set up the testing package files in the repository, or both.
  % endif
  
  ---
  
  First, we'll ask about the GitHub secrets.
  
  %if not is_org_admin:
  **Pause here.** In order to answer the next question, you may have to contact an admin.
  
  Ask your repository or GitHub organization admin whether the {right GitHub secrets} have been set up already for the repository or for the organization. You can tell them to look at the repository's GitHub secrets setting.

content: |
    **What are GitHub secrets?**

    [GitHub secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets) encrypt and store sensitive information that the automated tests need. To read more about why, go to the last section on this page.
    
    ---
    
    **Who can set a GitHub secret?**
    
    An admin of a GitHub **organization** can set the secrets for that GitHub organization. They can do that through this tool or just on GitHub itself. They can also set the secrets in repositories that belong to that organization.
    
    An admin of a GitHub **repository** can set the secrets for that GitHub repository on the GitHub website itself.
    
    A collaborator of a GitHub **repository** can set the secrets for the GitHub repository through **this tool**. A non-admin is unable to set secrets on GitHub itself. Yes, it's confusing. We don't know GitHub works that way ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
    
    ---

    **Does my repository or organization already have GitHub secrets?**
    
    A non-admin cannot see organization or repository secrets. They will have to ask an admin.
    
    If you're not sure what secrets your organization has set, ask an **org admin** to take a look. They can [see them in the same place that they can create them](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-an-organization).

    If you're not sure what secrets your repository has, ask a **repository admin** to take a look. They can [see them in the same place that they can create them](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository).

    If you're not sure whether a repository has access to its organization's secrets, ask a repository admin to take a look. They can see those on the repository's secrets page too, as described above.

    If the organization has these secrets, but the secrets are not showing up in the package's repository, the organization admin may need to [change the access settings for the secret](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets#reviewing-access-to-organization-level-secrets).
    
    ---

    **Why do these tests need GitHub secrets?**

    When you commit or push a file to GitHub, the automated tests will tell GitHub to:
    
    1. Log into a docassemble account on your server.
    1. Make a new Project. The name will start with "testing".
    1. Pull your package's GitHub code from the branch that they are testing.
    1. Go through the interview as if the tests were a real person.
    1. Delete the Project it created.

    To do some of those steps, the automated tests need to know a user name and password to use to log into a developer account on your server.

    If you choose to set up secrets, your answers will help this tool set these secrets:

    ${ secrets_list }

question: |
  Before we start
subquestion: |
  Look at the url of this page. Is this the server where the tests will run?
yesno: will_test_on_this_server
---
id: logged_into_test_account_on_interview_server
question: |
  What account are you logged in on?
subquestion: |
  You, your team, or your organiztion might {want to set up an account just for running tests}. The tests can also just run on your account.

  Are you logged into the docassemble account where the tests will run?
yesno: logged_into_test_account_on_interview_server
terms:
  want to set up an account just for running tests: |
    Tap the "Why have a testing account?" button below to learn why you might want to set up an account just for running tests.
help:
  label: Why have a testing account?
  content: ${ why_special_account }
---
template: why_special_account
content: |
  **Why would you want to set up an account just for testing?**
  
  First, GitHub will use that account. It will create Projects in there, put files in those Projects, then it will delete those Projects. If a developer is using that docassemble account, they may find it confusing.
  
  Secondly, it may cause problems later on. Imagine that the tests are set up to run on a developer's account. Then the developer leaves the team and deletes their account. The tests will fail because the account is missing.
---
id: log_into_test_account
question: |
  Before you continue
subquestion: |
  To help you answer the following questions, you may want to log into the account where the tests will run. Since this form is on the same server as this interview and you are not logged into that account, you can do one of 3 things:
  
  * [Open an incognito window](https://techbrightsystems.com/incognito-mode/) and log into that account there.
  * Log into that account on a different browser.
  * Leave this interview, log into that account, and start this interview again.

  Tap to continue when you are ready.

  As described, {the tests need some GitHub secrets}. This tool will help you set up these encrypted [GitHub secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets):
  
  ${ secrets_list }

  If you have not already done so:
  
  1. Decide on the docassemble account where the tests will run.
  1. Make sure you are logged in there.
  1. Answer the questions below for that account. If you want to use your own account, put your own docassemble email and password below.
fields:
  - Account email: installer.email
    datatype: email
  - Account password: installer.password
    datatype: password
  - note: |
      Go to the Playground of the account and run any working YAML file. For example, **test.yml**. What is {the URL in the address bar}? Example:[BR]

question: |
  Authorizing for GitHub
subquestion: |
  This tool needs GitHub authorization - a [personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token). You can delete it at the end.
  
  The token will let this tool:
  
  % if secrets_need == 'repo' or secrets_need == 'org':
  ${ '1.' if wants_to_set_up_tests else '' } Create or update GitHub secrets.
  % endif
  % if wants_to_set_up_tests:
  ${ '1.' if secrets_need == 'repo' or secrets_need == 'org' else '' } Add these folders and files to the repository on a new branch:
  
  ${ files_list }
  
  Then this interview will make a pull request with that branch.
  % endif
  
  1. Start making a [personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token).
  % if secrets_need == 'org':
  1. Tap the checkbox for "admin:org" permissions.
  % endif
  % if wants_to_set_up_tests or secrets_need == 'repo':
  1. Tap the checkbox for "workflow" permissions. That should also trigger "repo" permissions.
  % endif
  1. Finish creating the token.
  1. Copy the token and paste it below.
fields:
  - Personal access token: installer.token
    datatype: password
    help: |
      The token must have ${ token_permissions_scope } permissions.
  - note: |
      We also need the GitHub repository URL of the package. Example:[BR]

  You can write your first test now if you want:
  
  1. Pull the new code into a new Project.
  1. In the Playground, go to your Sources folder.
  1. Add a new file called 'interview_loads.feature'.
  1. Copy this code into the example file:
  
        <pre>
      @load
      Feature: Interviews load

        Scenario: \\_\\_\\_\\_ loads with no error
          Given I start the interview at "\\_\\_\\_\\_"
        </pre>

  5. Replace \\_\\_\\_\\_ with the name of the YAML file you're testing.
  1. Save the file.
  1. On your Packages page Sources section, select the file.
  1. Save the package.
  1. Commit the change to GitHub on a new branch.
  1. [Go to your actions page](https://github.com/${ installer.owner_name }/${ installer.repo_name }/actions) and explore.
  1. If it passes, make a pull request, request a review, and get the branch merged in.
