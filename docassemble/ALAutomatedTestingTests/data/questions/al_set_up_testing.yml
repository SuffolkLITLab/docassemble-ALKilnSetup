  Set up AL automated integrated testing
subquestion: |
  This interview will help you set up automated integrated GitHub testing for your docassemble project.
  
  Your answers will be encrypted end-to-end and on the server. No one other than you will have access to it. You **must** make sure your GitHub account has permission to change files in the correct repository.

  :clock: This could take about 15 minutes
  
  We will need you to give us:
  
  1. A [GitHub personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token) with 'repo' level permissions.
  1. Your docassemble testing account's sign-in information. That can be your account if you want it to be.

  This tool will add some files to different folders in your interview's GitHub repository:

  1. `tests/features/example_test.feature` is a very simple example of a test.
  1. `.github/workflows/run_interview_tests.yml` tells GitHub when and how to run the tests.
  1. `package.json` tells GitHub what packages the tests need.
  1. `.gitignore` is for developers who want to work in their local environment.
  1. `.env-example` can help guide developers who want to work in their local environment.
  
  It will also add 3 [GitHub secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets):
  
  1. PLAYGROUND_EMAIL
  1. PLAYGROUND_PASSWORD
  1. PLAYGROUND_ID

  Docassemble
subquestion: |
  Use the information for the account that should run the tests to answer the questions below. You can use your own account as the testing account.
fields:
  - Testing account's email: installer.email
    datatype: email
  - Testing account's password: installer.password
    datatype: password
  - note: |
      From inside the testing account, hit 'Save and Run' in the YAML file you want to test. What is the URL in the address bar? Example of a valid URL:[BR]
      `https://dev.court-wizards.org/interview?i=docassemble.playground222ProjectName%3Asome_file.yml`
  - Interview URL: installer.playground_url

  Interview URL: |
    The interview URL will give us the account's Playground ID and the address of the server that the account is on.

id: github auth
question: |
  GitHub authorization
subquestion: |
  In order to change files in your GitHub repository, we need permission. If you have permission to change the files of the repository, you can give us permission too.
  
  To do that, create a [personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token). You can delete the token any time after confirming the setup has worked. You can also use a new one anytime.
fields:
  - GitHub repository URL: installer.repo_url
    help: "The repository's URL will give us the name of the repo and its owner."
  - Personal access token: installer.token
    datatype: password
    help: "As long as you have permission to change the repository's files, your personal access token will give us permission to change them too."

  Next steps
subquestion: |
  % if defined( 'installer.pull_url' ):
  1. Check [the pull request](${ installer.pull_url }) and merge it in if it looks good.
  1. Once you've merged your pull request into your default branch (usually 'main' or 'master') [go to your actions page](https://github.com/${ installer.owner_name }/${ installer.repo_name }/actions) to see the first example test being run.
  % else:
  1. [Go to your actions page](https://github.com/${ installer.owner_name }/${ installer.repo_name }/actions) to see the example test being run.
  % endif
  1. If it fails the firs time, [rerun the test (job)](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/managing-workflow-runs/re-running-a-workflow).
  1. If it fails again:
      1. Check the .github/workflows/run_interview_tests.yml `env:` section to make sure your docassemble server name is right.
      1. If it is wrong, you can [edit the file in GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-files-in-a-repository/editing-files-in-your-repository).
      1. [Edit the values](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository) of [the repository secrets](https://github.com/${ installer.owner_name }/${ installer.repo_name }/secrets) manually to make sure that the email address, password, and id are for the correct account on the correct server. GitHub will not let you see the old values as that would be a breach of security.
      1. [Run the test manually](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/managing-workflow-runs/manually-running-a-workflow#running-a-workflow-on-github).
      1. If tests still fail, [see if someone has posted a related issue](https://github.com/plocket/docassemble-ALAutomatedTestingTests/issues) in our repository. If not, [file a new issue](https://github.com/plocket/docassemble-ALAutomatedTestingTests/issues/new) that includes the link to the manual test that was run. Leave that test alone so others can see what's going on. Avoid 'rerunning' that job.
  1. When that test run is over, see if you can [run the workflow manually from the actions menu](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/managing-workflow-runs/manually-running-a-workflow#running-a-workflow-on-github).

  If everything passes, all should be well and you should be ready to write your first tests. Delete the [personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) you created.
  
  If you have some feedback, we would love to hear from you. [Make an issue in our repository](https://github.com/plocket/docassemble-ALAutomatedTestingTests/issues/new) to tell us about it.

  TODO: Should we offer to delete their personal access token for them in the interview itself? Do we have enough permissions?
